# ELECTION ANALYSIS
Create an Election Analysis "PyPoll" with Python
## Overview of Project
A Colorado Board of Elections employee has given you the following task to complete the election audit of a recent local congressional election.

1. Calculate the total number of votes cast.
2. Get a complete list of candidates who received votes.
3. Calculatae the total number of votes each candidate received.
4. Calculate the percentage of votes each candidate won.
5. Determine the winner of the election based on popular vote.

## Resources

* Data Source: election_results.csv
* Software: Python 3.9, Visual Studio Code 1.50.0

For more information, read the [`Documentation on Python data typess`](https://docs.python.org/3.6/library/stdtypes.html#numeric-types-int-float-complex). 

## Analysis and Challenges
In this project, our final Python script will need to be able to deliver the following information when the script is run: 

1. Total number of votes cast
2. A complete list of candidates who received votes
3. Total number of votes each candidate received
4. Percentage of votes each candidate won
5. The winner of the election based on popular vote

#### Our Challenge Data Background
> After giving you an overview of the election audit tasks, we wants to go over the steps required in detail. Showing you a technique commonly used by programmers to write steps of their code, which is called `pseudocode`. Pseudocode will make the audit easier to present to nontechnical colleagues and stakeholders.

To facilitate the design process, programmers use `pseudocode` to create models or flowcharts for their programs. 
Pseudocode is like a roadmap of what you think your code will look like or the steps you'll take to complete the task at hand.

Pseudo means **"fake,"** so pseudocode is essentially fake code. Pseudocode is an informal language that has no syntax rules and is not meant to be executed. The point of using pseudocode is to focus on the overall design of the program.

## Candidate Results
### Deliverable Requirements:
Using repetition statements, conditional statements with logical operators, and print statements, print out the candidate and county election results to the command line.

1. Total Votes in the election are printed to the terminal.
2. Each candidate’s total votes and percentage of votes are printed to the terminal.
3. The winner of the election, winning vote count, and winning percentage of votes are printed to the terminal.
